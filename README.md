## Overview

This repository contains both the Database Project and FullStack JavaScript (FSJS) Projects. Each project is located in its respective folder within the repository.

### Database Project

The Database Project folder contains the implementation of a relational database system for a virtual video game store called Virtual Vault. The database schema, SQL queries, and database management scripts are provided to efficiently manage various aspects of the video game store, including inventory, customers, transactions, employees, and more.

### FullStack JavaScript (FSJS) Project

The FullStack JavaScript (FSJS) Project folder contains a comprehensive implementation of a web application using JavaScript technologies for both the frontend and backend. This project focuses on managing user tokens within a web application environment. It includes modules for generating, updating, fetching, and searching user tokens, along with an Express.js server for handling HTTP requests.
